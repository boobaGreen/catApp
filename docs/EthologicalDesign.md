# Ethological Design & Audio Guidelines 🧠🔊

Scientific principles for maximizing feline engagement and minimizing frustration.

## 1. The "Laser Pointer" Problem (Frustration Mitigation)
**Science**: Cats have a predatory sequence: Stalk -> Chase -> Pounce -> Kill -> Eat.
Laser pointers (and screens) break this cycle at "Pounce/Kill". The prey just vanishes or is intangible. This causes **frustration**, anxiety, and eventually disinterest.

**Solution for Screen Games**:
*   **"Escape" Feedback**: If the prey isn't caught, it shouldn't just vanish. It should "escape" (scurry off-screen or into a hole). This gives closure: "I missed it" vs "It ceased to exist".
*   **Tactile Catch (Haptics)**: Use maximum vibration on "Kill" to simulate physical impact.
*   **Auditory Closure**:
    *   **Kill**: Satisfying "Crunch", "Squeak", or "Thud".
    *   **Miss**: A "Swoosh" or "Rustle" indicating rapid escape.

## 2. Psychoacoustic Attractors
Cats hear up to 64kHz (Humans ~20kHz). They are tuned to:
*   **High-Frequency Squeaks (Rodents)**: The most potent trigger.
*   **Rustling/Scratching**: Simulates prey moving in undergrowth. often more stimulating than visual movement alone.
*   **"Pspsps" / Hissing**: Mimics small prey or social signals.

**Background Ambiance**:
*   *Avoid* White Noise (Calming/Sleep inducing).
*   *Use* "Bio-Acoustic" Nature Sounds: Faint leaves rustling, distant bird chirps. This creates a "hunting ground" atmosphere.

## 3. Prey-Specific Audio Profiles

| Prey Type | Movement Sound (Continuous/Loop) | Event Sound (Spawn/Turn) | Death/Catch Sound | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mouse** | Soft patter / Scratching on wood | High-pitch "Squeak" | Loud Squeak + Thud | Classic predator trigger. |
| **Fly / Insect** | Low volume "Buzz" (Doppler effect) | Sharp Buzz | "Crunch" / "Splat" | Irritating fly buzz triggers "swat" reflex. |
| **Worm** | Wet "Slither" / "Squish" | Earth/Soil crumble | "Squish" / "Pop" | Disgust/Interest trigger. |
| **Bird/Feather**| Flapping wings (Whomp-Whomp) | Chirp / Whistle | "Feather Poof" / Squawk | Simulates airborne prey. |
| **Laser** | *Silent* (or faint electric hum) | Sharp "Click" (Reflect) | *None* (Intangible) | Pure visual chase. |

## 4. Reward & Reinforcement
**Goal**: Keep the cat "in the zone" (Flow State).
*   **On Kill**: Immediate positive feedback (Sound + Visual Explosion + Haptic).
*   **Post-Session**: If the cat played well (high kill count), play a "Purring" sound or "Treat Bag Shake" sound on the Score Screen. This bridges the gap to a real-world reward (owner should give a treat!).

## Implementation Rules
1.  **Positional Audio**: Sounds *must* pan left/right with the prey. Cats locate by sound.
2.  **Randomization**: Never play the exact same "squeak.mp3" twice. Pitch-shift by ±10% every time to prevent habituation.
3.  **Silence is Golden**: Don't overfill the spectrum. Sudden sounds from silence are more startled/engaging than a noisy cacophony.
