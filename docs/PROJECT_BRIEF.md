# 🦁 FELIS: Apex Hunter - Project Brief

**"The First Mobile Game Designed for Apex Predators."**

## 🎯 The Vision
CatEngage isn't just a "game for cats." It is an **Ethological Training Tool**.
Most cat games are just random animations. We use science-backed triggers (450-550nm light spectrum, 3-8kHz ultrasonic audio, and specific movement algorithms) to stimulate a cat's dormant predatory instincts.
**We transform House Cats into Apex Predators.**

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture "The TWA Stack"

We use a modern **Hybrid Architecture** to combine the speed of Web Development with the distribution of the Google Play Store.

*   **Core**: React + TypeScript (Vite).
*   **Engine**: Custom HTML5 Canvas Engine (Zero dependencies, 60FPS).
*   **Distribution**: Trusted Web Activity (TWA). The Android App is a thin "Shell" that loads the website.
    *   *Benefit*: Instant Updates. Pushing code to Vercel updates the app on all phones instantly.
*   **Styling**: TailwindCSS (Utility-first).

## 💰 Monetization Strategy "The Predator Path"

We use a **Freemium** model based on retention and identity, not ads.

1.  **The Hook (Free)**:
    *   Players get "The Golden Minute" (60s of full intensity).
    *   After 60s, the game downgrades to "Boring Mode" (Slow mice only).
2.  **The Value (Pro)**:
    *   **Unlimited Play**: No timers.
    *   **Full Ecosystem**: Cockroaches, Worms, Birds (High variance).
    *   **Apex Dashboard**: A stats page that tracks their cat's "Rank" (House Cat -> Apex Predator) based on real kill data.
    *   **Pricing Strategy (Retention Focused)**:
        *   **Monthly**: €0.99 (Entry Level impulse buy).
        *   **Yearly**: €9.99 (The "Standard" choice).
        *   **Lifetime**: €19.99 (Premium Anchor - pushes users to subscription).

## 🚀 Go-To-Market

*   **Platform**: Android-First (PWA/TWA).
