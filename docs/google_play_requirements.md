# Google Play Store: Path to Production (Personal Accounts)

Since November 2023, Google requires developers with personal accounts to prove the quality of their app before publishing to Production.

## The Core Requirement
**"20 Testers for 14 Days"**

Before you can apply for Production access, you must run a **Closed Testing** track that meets these criteria:
1.  **20 Testers**: You must have at least 20 people opted-in to your test.
2.  **Continuous Testing**: They must have opted-in for at least **14 consecutive days**.
3.  **Active Engagement**: Google monitors if testers are actually installing and using the app.

## Step-by-Step Strategy

### Phase 1: Preparation (Current Status: 🚧)
- [ ] **Identity Verification**: Waiting for Google approval (24-48h).
- [ ] **Internal Testing**: Upload AAB once verified.
- [x] Critical bugs fixed (TWA/Start URL).
- [x] App is stable.

### Phase 2: Recruitment (The "Cat Army")
You need to recruit **20-25 testers** (aim for >20 to be safe if someone drops out).

**Where to find them:**
*   **LinkedIn**: Post a "Call for Beta Testers". Mention it's an ethological tool for cats.
*   **Friends & Family/Colleagues**: The easiest source.
*   **Reddit/Discord**: Communities like r/AndroidDev or r/Cats.
*   **Process**: You will need their **Gmail addresses** to add them to the email list in the Play Console.

### Phase 3: The 14-Day Text
1.  Promote your release from **Internal Testing** to **Closed Testing** in the Console.
2.  Add your list of 20+ emails.
3.  Send them the link and ensure they **Install** the app.
4.  **Monitor**: Keep the test active for 14 days. Encourage them to verify/report feedback occasionally.

### Phase 4: Application for Production
After 14 days, a new button "**Apply for Production**" will appear in the Dashboard.
You will answer questions about:
*   How you recruited testers.
*   What feedback you received.
*   What changes you made.

Once approved (usually 1-7 days), you can publish to the world! 🌍
