# CatEngage - Professional Game Manual

## Philosophy: "Cat-First Design" 🐱
CatEngage is not just a game; it is an ethologically accurate simulation designed to stimulate feline predatory instincts. Every mechanic, sound, and movement pattern has been tuned based on research into cat vision and behavior.

### Key Principles
1.  **High Contrast**: Cats see motion and contrast better than color. We use high-visibility Blue/Green/Yellow spectrums against a deep black void.
2.  **Sound Triggers**: Preys emit ultrasonic chirps (3-8kHz range) that trigger the "hunting" ear reflex.
3.  **Haptic Feedback**: Meaningful vibration ("Crunch" on kill, "Heartbeat" on stalk) provides tactile satisfaction.

## The "Director" AI 🎬
Unlike simple loops, CatEngage uses a sophisticated algorithm called **The Director** to manage the game session. It ensures your cat is never bored, nor over-stimulated.

### The Infinite Progression System
The game tracks your cat's "Hunter Rank" across its lifetime (persistent stats). As your cat improves, the ecosystem adapts.

| Era | Kills Range | Description | New Challenges |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. The Awakening** | 0 - 50 | Learning to track objects. | **Mice** (Slow, predictable). |
| **II. Precision** | 50 - 250 | Developing accuracy. | **Worms** (Small, Wiggly). |
| **III. The Hunt** | 250 - 1000 | Mastering reflexes. | **Insects** (Fast, erratic, Fleeing). |
| **IV. Apex Predator** | 1000+ | The ultimate challenge. | **Adaptive AI**. The Director counters your cat's favorite prey. |
